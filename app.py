# Each file in 'pages/' becomes a new page in the sidebar.
# The filename (excluding the leading number and underscore, and with underscores replaced by spaces)
# is used as the page name in the sidebar.
# e.g., pages/1_ğŸ“ˆ_Market_Trend_Analyzer.py becomes "ğŸ“ˆ Market Trend Analyzer"
# e.g., pages/market_trend_analyzer.py becomes "Market Trend Analyzer"
# e.g., pages/2_ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³_Indian_Indices_Dashboard.py will become "ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ Indian Indices Dashboard"
